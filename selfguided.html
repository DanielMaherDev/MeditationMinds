                        <h3>Why is breathing so important?</h3>
                        <p>The act of focused breathing allows us to enter a space away from the hectic life surrounding
                            us.
                            There is a couple of reasons why this type of intentional breathing allows this:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With a calm deep dreath, we are telling our internal systems to calm the body & mind
                                down.</li>
                            <li>By keeping our attention focused on our breath, we can learn to take away the
                                significance of things that we may otherwise unneccessarily focus on such as anxious
                                thoughts</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="exercise">
                            <p>This exercise is helpful in introducing yourself to breathing and its use in meditation
                                at a fundamental level. It's completely normal to find this exercise difficult in the
                                beginning. The hope is that over time you can build up experience, allowing you to
                                increase the duration you are able to complete this. </p>

                                <!-- some content here has been taken from https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-relief-breathing-techniques-->
                                <li>Find yourself a space where you can relax, and ideally not be interrupted. This
                                    could be your bedroom, garden, or anywhere that works best for you</li>
                                <li>Sit in a comfortable position, but a position where you are still alert. For some,
                                    this can be on the ground, with legs crossed and back in a upright but relaxed
                                    position.</li>
                                <li>Breathe in through your nose. Let your belly fill with air.<span>(It is important
                                        that nothing is forced. This is about allowing your body to breath into your
                                        core, but forcing this can actually increase tension and stress)</span> </li>
                                <li>Breathe out through your nose.
                                </li>
                                <li>You should feel your belly rise as it fills with air. Your chest can of course also
                                    rise. but the goal is to feel this air travel to your stomach.</li>
                                <li>Continue this process for as long as you feel comfortable to do so. A recommendation
                                    is to spend 5-10 minutes repeating this erecise, but you can do whatever works for
                                    you.</li>

                        <h3>What is body scanning?</h3>
                        <p>Body Scanning is the act of focusing on parts of the body from head to toe, usually in
                            sequence
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
                        <p>By scanning through your body, we are focussing on specific individual parts of our body,
                            which allows us to become aware of places we may be holiding tension or stress.</p>
                        <div class="exercise">
                            <p>For this exercise, we are introducing ourselves to the concept of being aware, but not
                                with the intention of trying to force change. Rather, we are watching ourselves, similar
                                to watching traffic pass, we are on the sidewalk watching, but not looking to stop this
                                traffic. </p>

                                <li>Similar to the breath exercise, find a comfortable, quiet space. For this exercise,
                                    we recommend lying on your back, but you can do whatever is more comfortable for
                                    you.</li>
                                <li>Start by placing your focus on the top of your head. Listen to your body,
                                    specifically the top of your head.</li>
                                <li>Do you feel tension? Is this area aching? Don't feel the need to release this
                                    stress, pain, or anything else you are feeling. Of course, allow this to happen if
                                    it is coming naturally, but again, no force should be required here. </li>
                                <li>Check in on your breathing, and allow yourself to take deep, calming breaths.
                                </li>
                                <li>From here, move on downwards through your body, and repeat this process.</li>
                                <li>When you get to the bottom of your toes, you can begin to move from here, all the
                                    way back to the top of your head. Make note of how you feel after each scan, but
                                    again, dont look for anything specifically. It is okay if you do not feel
                                    improvement, once you have completed this process without trying to control these
                                    things.</li>

                        Taken to extremes, of course, that’s true. Most people, however, find that meditation creates

                        <h3>What is the purpose of resetting?</h3>
                        <p>One way I like to answer this question, is to reference other things in life that show
                            parallels to this beaviour. For example, a computer which has been running for several
                            hours, working through information, can become slow, sluggish, and performs at a lesser
                            quality than when it initially woke. The same can be said for us. A short restart of this
                            computer can bring it back to its best performance. The same can also be said for us.
                        </p>

                        <div class="exercise">
                            <p>As mentioned, we want mindfulness to be accessible for everyone. For some, life is too
                                busy or hectic to make time for a longer meditation session. This exercise takes no more
                                than 2 minutes out of your day, and should helo with resetting your mind,F</p>

                                <li>Onwce again, find a comfortable, quiet space where you will not be distracted or
                                    interrupted.</li>
                                <li>Close your eyes, or look downwards away from distraction</li>
                                <li>Allow, but dont force, your body to release tension. You can drop your shoulders,
                                    loosen your jaw, etc. </li>
                                <li>Notice your body, does it feel heavy, light, tense? How do you feet feel on the
                                    ground?
                                </li>
                                <li>You can now proceed to inhale through the nose, and
                                    exhale through the mouth, noticing the pause in between the exhale, and then
                                    noticing the beginning of next inhale, and exhale, just relaxing the body.</li>
                                <li>Allow your breath to reset to its natural rhythm. Allow your mind to breath with
                                    each inhale and exhale.</li>
                                <li>You can repeat this process for as long as you like, but a short span of this
                                    exercise should really help with resetting!</li>
