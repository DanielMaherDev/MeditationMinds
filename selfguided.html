                        <h3>Why is breathing so important?</h3>
                        <p>The act of focused breathing allows us to enter a space away from the hectic life surrounding
                            us.
                            There is a couple of reasons why this type of intentional breathing allows this:

                        <ul>
                            <li>With a calm deep dreath, we are telling our internal systems to calm the body & mind
                                down.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>By keeping our attention focused on our breath, we can learn to take away the
                                significance of things that we may otherwise unneccessarily focus on such as anxious
                                thoughts</li>

                                at a fundamental level. It's completely normal to find this exercise difficult in the
                                beginning. The hope is that over time you can build up experience, allowing you to
                                increase the duration you are able to complete this. </p>

                                <li>Find yourself a space where you can relax, and ideally not be interrupted. This
                                    could be your bedroom, garden, or anywhere that works best for you</li>
                                <li>Sit in a comfortable position, but a position where you are still alert. For some,
                                    this can be on the ground, with legs crossed and back in a upright but relaxed
                                    position.</li>
                                <li>Breathe in through your nose. Let your belly fill with air.<span>(It is important
                                        that nothing is forced. This is about allowing your body to breath into your
                                        core, but forcing this can actually increase tension and stress)</span> </li>
                                <li>Breathe out through your nose.

                                <li>You should feel your belly rise as it fills with air. Your chest can of course also
                                    rise. but the goal is to feel this air travel to your stomach.</li>
                                <li>Continue this process for as long as you feel comfortable to do so. A recommendation
                                    is to spend 5-10 minutes repeating this erecise, but you can do whatever works for
                                    you.</li>
